              <p>
                <span>The N95 mask</span> is a form of respiratory protective
                wear worn over the nose and mouth to help minimise the chance of
                inhaling airborne particles like viruses and other germs. It is
                a disposable mask made from synthetic polymer fibres produced in
                a highly specialised process called melt blowing. During this
                process, the inner layer of the N95 mask is created which forms
                the filtration layer capable of filtering out at
                <span>least 95%</span> of airborne particles when worn
                correctly.
              </p>
              <p>
                During outbreaks of respiratory illnesses and during periods of
                intense air pollution, wearing <span>N95 masks</span> has been
                shown to help reduce the inhalation of compromised air,
                filtering out nasty pathogens which lead to illness or which can
                aggravate existing respiratory problems. Maintaining clear and
                unhindered respiration is vitally important for remaining fit
                and healthy and people with pre-existing conditions or
                respiratory fragility can particularly benefit from wearing face
                masks while they are out in public and unable to control the
                breathing environments that they find themselves in.

                N95 Respirators In Industrial And Health Care Settings
              </h3>
              <p>
                Most <span>N95 respirators</span> are manufactured for use in
                construction and other industrial type jobs that expose workers
                to dust and small particles. They are regulated by the National
                Personal Protective Technology Laboratory (NPPTL) in the
                National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH),
                which is part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
                (CDC).
              </p>
              <p>
                However, some N95 respirators are intended for use in a health
                care setting. Specifically, single-use, disposable respiratory
                protective devices used and worn by health care personnel during
                procedures to protect both the patient and health care personnel
                from the transfer of microorganisms, body fluids, and
                particulate material. These surgical N95 respirators are class
                II devices regulated by the FDA, under 21 CFR 878.4040, and CDC
                NIOSH under 42 CFR Part 84.
